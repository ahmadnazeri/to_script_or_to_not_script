# To Script or To Not Script
This is a repo for random scripts that I have created along the way to try something out or learn a new algorithm.


### Scripts
- **monty_hall**: This script tests out the Monty Hall Problem with >= 3 doors and as many trials as you want. Recommend less than 10,000,000 trials.
